* Emacs
This is my emacs configuration. This is not an distribution but feel free to use it.

I stopped using package managers because they increase the load time on Windows. Instead, packages I want are managed as git submodules in the [[https://github.com/danielyaren/emacs.d/tree/main/lib][lib]] directory and configured with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].

* Installation

To install:

#+begin_src conf
git clone https://github.com/danielyaren/emacs.d.git .emacs.d
cd .emacs.d
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src
